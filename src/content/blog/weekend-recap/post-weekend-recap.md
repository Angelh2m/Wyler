Hi everyone!

I hope you all had a great weekend. I sure did! I just love the weekends (but who doesn’t?). I honestly didn’t do much this weekend, though, just relaxed and worked on some web development projects. I was actually wanting to go to this awesome looking flea market in Canton, TX this weekend called the First Monday Trade Days (it’s the oldest and largest flea market in the US), but I ended up getting a really bad headache and not being able to go. :( The flea market happens once a month, though, so hopefully we can go next month if it’s not too cold! I would love to find some cute and interesting items for our new apartment. We need something to go on the wall above the dining table… I’m thinking a huge, antique (or antique-looking) mirror or maybe a vintage Texas flag (now that I can call myself a Texan, I feel like I need a flag). But we’ll see. 

We also ordered a pizza from Papa Johns. Papa Johns is seriously our most favorite pizza place. Even when we lived in NYC, we only ordered Papa Johns! We did try a few other pizza places but we just never liked any as much as Papa Johns… I know, we’re weird. Also, their garlic knots are the. best. ever. Oh my gosh.

Actually, funny/crazy story: The Papa Johns we used to go to in Brooklyn was a few blocks from our apartment. One day we decided to go pick up a pizza, and guess what we saw? There were around 5 massive bullet holes in the place! Yeah, it was crazy. We still got our pizza, but we got out of there VERY quickly. But that’s Brooklyn for ya. Yet another reason why I’m so happy to be out of there and living in beautiful (and relatively safe) Dallas. 

We also watched the movie “Searching”, which was really good, and I started a new book called “Then She Was Gone” by Lisa Jewell. I’ll let you know what I think about it, but so far it’s definitely holding my attention. Have you seen that movie and/or read that book? If so, what did you think?

Other than that, we we just did some grocery shopping. I know, we’re boring. BUT, I just discovered Walmart grocery pick-up, and it is seriously amazing! It’s sooo much faster than actually going to the grocery store, but the best part is that it’s FREE. I’ve done it a few times now, and I think our grocery bill is actually lower than when we used to go into the actual store. It’s just so much easier to compare all the prices for everything online than in the store. Also, when you get there it only takes them about 5 minutes to get all your groceries together and then you can be on your way again -- amazing, right? It seriously saves so much time. And I know a lot of people are wary about ordering produce with these kinds of services, but so far all the produce I’ve ordered has been in perfect condition. It actually seems like they only give me the best of the best. Another great thing is that if they are out of a certain product, they will substitute it for something else, which usually ends up being better (and if it’s not, then you can just get refunded for the item you originally ordered). For example, I recently ordered 5 oz of feta cheese, but they were out of that specific brand, so they ended up substituting it for a different brand of feta which ended up being 6 oz. They gave me the same price, so I ended up getting more for the money! I would give the service 5 stars, easily. 

For dinner tonight I made this Israeli couscous & chicken sausage skillet. Honestly, I don't even know what couscous is.... Is it pasta? Is it a grain? I don't actually know. It seems like pasta.... I should probably go look that up now.

Anyway, the point here is that it was very good! I would definitely make it again, and Angel loved it. Also served it with a side salad to get some veggies in. 

 

What did everyone else do and eat over the weekend?

Till next time...

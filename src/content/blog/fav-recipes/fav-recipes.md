**Hi everyone!**

  

So, since it's now 2019, I’ve been thinking a lot about all my favorite recipes I tried in 2018..

  

Actually, these are my favorite recipes that I’ve tried since September… so only 3 months. But I’ve tried a lot! When we were living in Brooklyn, we only had access to a stove. We had to share a tiny kitchen with an extremely messy roommate (NYC was too expensive for us to get our own place), and she kept a bunch of pots and pans in the oven and hadn’t cleaned it in years. So consequently, we were limited to making simple one pot skillet meals (usually pasta, sausages, rice, chili… I think I ate enough chili and sausages for probably the next 10 years of my life).

  

So since moving to Dallas and having access to a stove, oven, and also buying an InstantPot, I feel like I’ve died and gone to heaven. I have a huuuge list of recipes I still want to try, and we’ve even come up with some of our own that I can’t wait to share with you all. I haven’t actually even made the same thing twice yet! After living in NYC, this just seems like a miracle.

  

So, without further ado, and in no particular order, here are my favorite recipes of 2018:

4.  [https://www.geniuskitchen.com/recipe/fannie-farmers-classic-baked-macaroni-cheese-135350](https://www.geniuskitchen.com/recipe/fannie-farmers-classic-baked-macaroni-cheese-135350) - Did you know that there are actually people out there that don’t like macaroni and cheese? I also find it hard to believe, BUT my husband is unfortunately one of those people. He, however, LOVED this recipe and wouldn’t shut up about how good it was!
    
5.  [https://damndelicious.net/2018/10/14/instant-pot-swedish-meatballs/](https://damndelicious.net/2018/10/14/instant-pot-swedish-meatballs/) - Soooooo flavorful, oh my gosh. The only thing I would do differently next time is brown the meatballs in the oven first, because it’s difficult and it takes too long to brown them in the instant pot since you have to do it in batches.
    
6.  [https://www.dessertfortwo.com/cheese-stuffed-chicken-breast/](https://www.dessertfortwo.com/cheese-stuffed-chicken-breast/) - Just delicious and so easy to make.
    
7.  [https://lifemadesweeter.com/instant-pot-lemon-garlic-chicken/](https://lifemadesweeter.com/instant-pot-lemon-garlic-chicken/) - my husband called these chicken carnitas because they legitimately turned out like pork carnitas, except they’re chicken. Also, my husband is from the carnitas capital in Mexico, so I think he knows what he’s talking about. The sauce is super creamy and have a great lemony flavor. Amazing. Next time I will double the recipe, though, because it didn’t make very much.
    
8.  [https://ifoodreal.com/instant-pot-cabbage-rolls/#comment-707139](https://ifoodreal.com/instant-pot-cabbage-rolls/#comment-707139) - I love cabbage rolls, but I definitely don’t want to spend all afternoon making them, so this is a great alternative, and it’s also pretty healthy!
    
9.  [https://ifoodreal.com/instant-pot-chicken-and-rice/](https://ifoodreal.com/instant-pot-chicken-and-rice/) - Yum. That’s all.
    
10.  [https://thegirlonbloor.com/instant-pot-red-curry-chicken-noodles/](https://thegirlonbloor.com/instant-pot-red-curry-chicken-noodles/) - Delicious sauce, but next time I’ll use dark meat. The chicken breasts turned out very dry.
    
11.  [https://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-cheesy-vegetable-melts-241997](https://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-cheesy-vegetable-melts-241997) - My husband said these were the best sandwiches he’s tried in his entire life. I agree. And there’s no meat on them! I don’t know how that’s possible, but it is. Also, the sauce for these includes mayo, and my husband doesn’t even like mayo, but he loved these.

I will definitely be making all of these again soon!

Also, I will most likely be posting my husband's **amazing** chilaquiles recipe this weekend, so stay tuned.

**Till next time...**

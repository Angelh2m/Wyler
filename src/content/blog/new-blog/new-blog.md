Hi everyone! 😋 My name is Annah, and this is my very first blog post. I am SO excited to finally start on this blog as I’ve been wanting to start a blog for quite awhile now. I’m thinking I will mainly blog about recipes I’ve tried, decorating tips, books, and anything else that pops into my mind! I’m not the most creative or interesting person, but I’m going to try my hardest to come up with some fun blog posts! 

A little about me...

I will be 28-years-old on December 20th (eek!)
I have a Bachelor’s degree in Spanish but ended up going into a totally different field (web development)
After I graduated from college, I moved to Queretaro, Mexico to teach English and met my husband there (and no -- he was not one of my students!)
My husband and I literally met each other on the street... He likes to say he found me on the street. I was walking back to my apartment and he passed by me, said “Hola”, and the rest is history!
We had a super fast wedding and got married only 6 months after meeting. I know, kind of crazy, but so far so good and he has no plans of leaving me! We’re even planning on buying a house within the next year (hopefully).
We got married in a super pretty and tiny chapel in Mexico, and we had an inexpensive but nice wedding. We only invited our families are we served some delicious carnitas at the reception.
I have the cutest black kitten in the world named Binx (we got him around Halloween and seeing as one of my favorite movies is Hocus Pocus, we decided to name after the black kitty from that movie). My husband was never a cat lover before getting him, but now he is 100% in love with him.
Even though I love music and I LOVE singing, I try not to listen to much music because I easily get songs stuck in my head and once I do, it becomes super difficult for me to fall asleep at night because I can’t stop singing those stupid songs in my head over and over and over….
I love food and eating, and if I could try something new every day, I would! I don’t love cooking as much, but I do it anyway since I love eating good food and I’m also super cheap.
That brings me to another topic… I’m extremely cheap and I absolutely hate spending money. I’m constantly looking for the best deals, and I usually end up buying almost everything from Walmart (yes, even clothes…).
My husband used to be a chef, so we are planning on blogging about some awesome recipes in the future 
I can literally spend all day watching HGTV.
I love reading! You can check out my goodreads profile here. 
I love using exclamation points and probably way overuse them (sorry in advance!).
We just moved to Dallas from NYC (but we’ve lived all over the place) and are super excited to start our lives here and blog all about it!

Well, that’s all for now. I’ll hopefully have another blog post coming soon!

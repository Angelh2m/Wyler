**Hi everyone!**

I just got around to writing a blog post about what I did over Christmas vacation.

  

My husband’s family lives in Mexico, and every year they go to Puerto Vallarta for their Christmas vacation. I went with them last year, and it was a blast! We stayed at the Hard Rock right on the beach, which is an all-inclusive hotel, so of course we ended up eating waaaay too much. They have something like four or five different restaurants, two pools, hot tubs in the rooms, and great hospitality! I would really recommend it. The beaches are also nice, but for me the water on Mexico’s west coast is too cold and rough, so I didn’t go into it.

  

This year, however, I wanted to go visit my dad. My husband went to Mexico to see his family and I went to Japan to see my dad for 10 days.

  

Two years ago my dad decided to take a job with the D.O.D. as a Special Education teacher on a military base in Zama, Japan. It’s a really great job, and they offer great benefits, so I’m really happy for him but I miss him way too much! It’s hard living so far away from him. He loves his life in Japan, though, and is very comfortable there. He even has a Japanese girlfriend who he’s been dating now for over a year!

  

We ended up doing a lot while I was there. We went to Kyoto for 2 days, which was actually only a 2 hour trip from his house on the bullet train. We did some typical tourist things, like going to the Nishiki Market, seeing the Golden Pavilion (a gorgeous Buddhist temple originally built in 1397), and seeing the old towns of Higashiyama and Gion, which both made me feel like I transported back to ancient Japan. We also ate some amazing food, like Okonomiyaki, which is a Japanese cabbage pancake (sounds weird but it’s really good), and tsukemen ramen. The ramen was the BEST ramen I’ve ever tasted (the restaurant is called Ginjo Ramen Kubota).The miso broth was almost more like a stew because it was so thick. Oh how I wish I could eat ramen like that here in the States! We actually ate it two nights in a row because I couldn’t stop thinking about it.

  

Back in Chuorinkan where my dad lives, we mainly just hung out, relaxed, watched some cute and kind of cheesy Christmas movies (A Christmas Prince and The Princess Switch), baked some Christmas cookies, played some games, went to the mall, ate grocery store sushi (it’s the best sushi ever and cheap compared to US sushi), hung out with my dad’s girlfriend and her 13-year-old daughter, went bowling, and did probably a bunch more things I’m forgetting right now.

  

I just had so much fun, and I was very sad to leave. It’s hard living so far away from family, and sometimes I feel very homesick! Does anyone else live really far from your families? If so, what do you usually do over the holidays?

  

****Till next time....****

**Hey everyone!**

  

I know it's Tuesday and I'm only now writing my weekend recap, but I still can’t believe how fast the weekend went. They always go way too fast, right? But I’m sure you know that. I feel like before we moved to Dallas, our weekends would go by so slowly, but now they just blaze by. Maybe it’s because we never used to do anything in New York…. That was probably it. Now we are so busy that we barely have time for anything and time just flies. Sometimes I just feel like being lazy and watching TV all day, but we are too busy right now, and there is still so much I want to do and see since moving here! Anyone have any recommendations?

  

We had a really fun weekend, and we only spent a total of $33 for bowling, going to the movies, going out to eat, and buying a lottery ticket (my first one ever :’D).

  

Now, the movies were actually free, but we DID spend a crazy amount of money on a large popcorn ($8). Honestly, I regret that. The popcorn wasn’t even very good and we only ate half. I feel completely ripped off for that. Anyway, I’m sure you all are wondering HOW the heck we got free movie tickets. Well, my husband is fortunate enough to have a cousin who works for Cinepolis, and he gave us 10 free tickets a few months ago! Usually we NEVER go to the movies because it’s just insanely expensive (especially the Cinepolis at Victory Park), so we’ve been loving having these free tickets. I really hope we get more soon since we’re almost out though.

  

However, if we don’t get free tickets again soon, then I saw that there is an awesome Groupon deal here in Dallas at a movie theater which gives you half off the tickets. So they end up being only $5, which is also super cheap for the movies. So we will probably do that in the future (but only if there is a movie that we really want to see).

  

So that was Saturday that we did that. And before we went to the movies, we also went out to eat at Smashburger. Smashburger, Shake Shack, and Wendy’s are my top favorite burger chains, but usually we end up going to Smashburger since it usually ends up being the cheapest. We only spent $4!!! For two double cheeseburgers and two smashfries! Amaaaazing! We did get $10 off our order, though, since I had 100 points on the app. Also, every time you go there, you can ask the cashier for a survey to fill out and then they will give you free fries. So we always do that, as well. I also still want to check out some of DFW’s local burger restaurants as well! The only reason we haven’t done that yet is because I don’t want to be disappointed!

  

Then Sunday afternoon around 12 we went bowling at the Plano Super Bowl. We’ve been really into bowling lately, but it’s just a shame that it’s such an expensive activity to do. Didn’t it used to be cheap?! Anyway, on Sundays before 1PM it’s only $1.50 per game per person, plus shoes. I think shoes were like $4.50 per person - pretty pricey if you ask me. So total was about $19 for us since we bowled three games. It was super fun though and I scored 114 on one game! My highest score yet! My lowest today was 69 though which is pretty bad…. Oh well.

  

Well, that’s about all we did this past weekend. We also watched the show Dirty John (so good!). I tried listening to the podcast awhile ago, but I can never pay attention to podcasts for some reason. I always zone out.

We also worked on some web development stuff, bought a lottery ticket (I wanted to buy one after watching the show Lottery Dream Home on HGTV - that’s my new favorite HGTV show), and we made chilaquiles! I will post the recipe soon.

  

Ok, well that’s it for now.

  

**Till next time…**

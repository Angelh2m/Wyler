Actually, these are my favorite recipes that I’ve tried since September… so only 3 months. But I’ve tried a lot! When we were living in Brooklyn, we only had access to a stove."

## **Hi everyone!**

I can’t wait to share this recipe with you guys because this is such a delicious, healthy, and EASY dinner (is there some kind of acronym for these words? Because I’m probably going to be saying them a lot on this blog…)! It only took about 15-20 minutes to prep everything! Plus it looks pretty! And double plus, you can impress your friends/family with it -- my husband was very impressed by it! I also ate it with a side of leftover red cabbage (another recipe that I’ll post in the future). The cabbage and chicken & veggies went perfectly together and made it even healthier, as well. Yay!

  

Also, my weekend was fairly boring, so I probably won’t be talking too much about that. What did we even do? I can’t even remember…. Let’s see…I believe we just ate some chilaquiles, went out for Indian food (which was meh), went to the gym, and oh, we drove to Mckinney, TX to visit and see if we’d like to live there (since we heard it’s nice and more affordable). It was very nice. The downtown is super cute, and I love how the houses up there have more land and aren’t right on top of each other, like the houses around here. However, I think it would just be too far for us. :/ It’s not out of the question, but I think we need to look at houses for sale that are closer to Irving (since that’s where the majority of the tech jobs are).

  

Ohhh and today we just watched the season finale of Dirty John! Wow!! Such a good show. We loved it. The ending was crazy…. Has anyone else watched this show yet? It’s definitely the best show I’ve seen for a long time. I need some more TV recommendations, though, because now I have nothing to watch. :(

  

Ok, so since I don’t have anything else to talk about, here’s that recipe:
